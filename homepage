<img src="growth is acceptance.jpg" height="400">
<br>
<h3>This is a mixed media collage I created. It is one of the multiple pieces that is a part of my Growth project. The collage consists of momentos I collected from attending the Sacramento Pride event in 2018. The collage is meant to symbolize always accepting and supporting those who are different from you, and that people of all sexuality, race, and gender are equal and should always be treated that way.</h3>

<h2>"Pressures of an Artist" (2020)</h2>

<img src="hopeful.jpg" height="400">
<br>
<h3>This piece consists of watercolor and metallic acrylic paint on watercolor paper, and it visualizes a female subject with flowers, surrounded by metallic stars. I made this piece in my college dorm in the beginning of the school year just to practice painting facial features. I titled the piece "Hopeful" because my urge to practice my portrait skills came from how excited I had been to start studying art at a new level.</h3>
<br>
<br>
<h2>"Blonded" (2019)</h2>
<img src="blonded.jpg" height="400">
<br>
<h3>This piece is a sketch that consists of micron pen and black marker on 9"x12" watercolor paper. It is inspired by musical artist Frank Ocean's album Blonde, that I hold very emotional value to, as this album has gotten me through emotionally good and bad times.</h3>

<h2>"Magic Hour" (2020)</h2>
<img src="magic hour.jpg" height="400">
<br>
<h3>This piece consists of acrylic paint on a 9"x12" canvas. It is inspired from musical artist Jhene Aiko's album "Chilombo". I made this painting because this is one of my favorite albums by my favorite musical artist. I also wanted to experiment creating a portrait using non-neutral colors, which I had never previously done.</h3></center>
